* The Code allows for a particular data key to be retrived indivisully.

Solution: We can retrived specific data indivisully by running the follwing command inside the running instance,

      curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/data_name

      whre data name is the specific data that you want to retrive indivisully.


We can also get the information/metadata of the instance based on some specific key-value pare or particular data
by using "aws ec2 describe" command with the help of filters. 

          Follwing are the command for it,

           aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro

           aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=Name"
           aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag-value,Values=Test-VM-KPMG"

For each of the above command we are getting the desired output.
Same way we have done for challege 2 To automate this, we can add this command in terraform local exec and by using the variables we can give the choice to user
to get the data based on its inputs.

Then the code will be like,

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "null_resource" "test-demo" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=${var.filter_option},Values=${var.filter_value}"
  }
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Please enter the region where your instance is located"
  type        = string
}

variable "filter_option" {
  description = "Please enter the filer option to filter out the instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "filter_value" {
  description = "Please enter the filter value to filter out the instance"
  type        = string
}
