* Key Points related to this Architecture

1) Security group will only have a port 80 and 443 open for the public users.
2) Database server will kept in a private subnet. it will communicate with the other tire by using NAT gateway or
   bastion host.
3) Only required route table rules will be defined for the connection between security gropus and NAT gateway/bastion host.
4) web server will have a apache server and application will in the tomcat.
5) application will be deployed as a war file in the tomcat server
6) autoscaling will have the conditions defined in there rules along with the max and min no of instance count.
7) server are kept in a two availability zone to handle the downtime if one of them get down for any resion.
8) inernet gatway will only have a association with the puclic subnet. no diercet access for private subnet.
9) only admin will perform all the managment related task in the management server.
10) all the Architecture are inside a one single VPC
11) RDS instance will be deplyed as a multi AZ. that will give the High availability for database.
12) same security group will be attached to all the public tire.
13) database will have its own security group with required port open for the communication.


NOTE***
This Architecture is 90% completed. the actual implementation involves autoacsling and load balencer which is not in the 
final code. beacuse of some time constaint and limitation in my personal aws account i was not able to create the resources.
that why i have not gone through with the autocaling and load balencer resources.
